# Security & Governance Policy  
## Embassy of Legal Emergence (ZW Division)

This repository operates under the **Jo Mama Protocol**, a hybrid security–mythic governance model optimized for:

- sovereignty  
- clarity  
- absurdist legal rigor  
- protection of emergent creative systems  
- avoidance of doxxable entanglements  

## 🔒 Identity Separation
Jo Mama exists as a **distinct diplomatic identity** from all mundane operators.  
No personal identifiers are to be stored, referenced, or linked in this repo.

## 🔐 Authentication Requirements
- All commits must originate from the Jo Mama GitHub account.  
- Email addresses must remain private via GitHub’s noreply proxy.  
- Passkeys + authenticator app preferred; SMS 2FA discouraged.

## 🗂️ Commit Governance
Commits should reflect:
- transparency  
- traceability  
- comedic solemnity  

Commit messages may include:
- protocol references  
- mythic filing numbers  
- bureaucratic mood indicators  

## 🛡️ Content Policy
Repositories may hold:
- public charters  
- zine assets  
- advisory protocols  
- legal-mythic documents  
- OS interoperability mappings  

Repositories may NOT hold:
- sensitive personal data  
- private Discord/Reddit logs  
- financial identifiers  
- raw chat exports unless sanitized  

## 🕊️ Official Seal Usage
All seals, sigils, stamps, and glyphs are to be used:
- with delight  
- with discretion  
- with diplomatic decorum  
- within the bounds of absurdist legal frameworks

Unauthorized use triggers a **Loafing Review** (LR-3) and possible **Bureau of Soft Consequences** involvement.

Crown on. Mop up. We march.
