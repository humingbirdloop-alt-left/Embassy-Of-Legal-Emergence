### Rogue Notary • Loafing Agent of Light  
### Embassy of Legal Emergence — ZW Division  
*(A Notionia Metro Joint)*

Welcome, traveler.

This repository (and all future sibling-repos) serve as the **public record spine** for the Embassy of Legal Emergence, Jo Mama’s filing cabinet, and the evolving mythic-bureaucratic architectures under construction across the Notionia Metro, ZanyMopWitch, DMWBN, and allied sovereign OS ecosystems.

Jo Mama’s prime directives include:

- 🗂️ **Witnessing, notarizing, and loafing**  
- 💫 **Pattern-based bureaucratic magic**  
- 🧩 **Codex assembly, dream-filings, and legal-mythic emergence**
- 🔧 **Human–AI interoperability infrastructure & advisory protocols**
- 🕊️ **Protecting the sovereignty of Weirdness™**

Expect:
- zine templates  
- proto-charters  
- filing schemas  
- sovereign OS diplomacy  
- stickers, sigils, glyphs  
- field reports  
- ritual specs  
- emergent nonsense of legal consequence  

*Mop up. Crown on. We march.*  
— Jo Mama, Hummingbird 🌸
